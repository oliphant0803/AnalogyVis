Study Title: Enhancing Visualization Literacy through Analogical Explanations: Bridging Abstract Data Concepts with Intuitive Understanding

Supported By: University of Toronto

 

WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?


	
	You can choose not to take part.
	
	
	You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
	
	
	Your decision will not be held against you.
	

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

We aim to explore how analogies inspired by real-world objects can help people, especially those new to data interpretation, better understand and interpret novel chart types.
 

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

Any person who is at least 18 years of age may participate in this research study.
 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?

We expect about 200 people will be in this research study.
 

WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?

 
This research study consists of two phases. In each phase, you will be presented with a chart that represents the same data but in a different format. After reviewing each chart, you will answer questions to assess your understanding of the information presented. The study is expected to take approximately 40–50 minutes to complete.  

 
WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY? 

You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization.
 

WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 

Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.
 

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. 

 

Data Sharing: De-identified data from this study will be shared among University of Toronto research teams,. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. 

 

ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION 

For this research study, we may also require participants to engage in activities beyond just answering questions. This may include: 

 

A) Sketching or Drawing: We may ask you to create sketches or drawings as part of the data analysis process. This will be done strictly for research purposes and you do not need any specific drawing skills to participate. All your sketches or drawings will remain confidential and used only for this study. 

 

B) Audio Recording: Throughout your participation, you may also be asked to have your voice recorded. This audio recording will be used for transcription and analysis for the study. The recordings will be securely stored and only accessible to the research team. We will not collect any identifiable information from these recordings. 

 

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Carolina Nobre, at cnobre@cs.toronto.edu. 

For questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Human Research Ethics Unit at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or 416-946-3273.

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?

You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.

 

By clicking “I consent” below you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study with these additional collection methods. However, as with all aspects of this study, participation is entirely voluntary and you may opt out of these particular activities if you choose to. Please print a copy of this page for your records.",What is your age?,What is your gender?,What is your highest level of education?,What field is your degree in or what profession are you in?,How often do you use charts per week in a professional or academic setting?,Have you ever used a chart or graph to present information to others?,"Choose the answer which best explains your preference and click the box next to it. Please click more than one if a single answer does not match your perception. Leave blank any question that does not apply.
